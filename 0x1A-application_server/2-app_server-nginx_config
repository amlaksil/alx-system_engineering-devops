##
# The code snippet below is a configuration code for a web server. It listens on port
# 80 and forwards requests to the port 5000 on the localhost. The proxy
# server also sets the following headers:
# * X-Forwarded-For: The IP address of the client that made the request.
# * X-Forwarded-Proto: The protocol used by the client (HTTP or HTTPS).
# * X-Forwarded-Host: The hostname of the client.
# * X-Forwarded-Prefix: The path prefix of the request.
# This configuration can be used to proxy requests from a web browser to a web
# application. For example, if you have a web application running on port 5000
# on your localhost, you can access it by visiting
# http://localhost:80/airbnb-onepage/ in your browser. The proxy server will
# forward the request to the web application and return the response to the browser.
