##
# The server block below provided a valid configuration for a web server. It listens
# on port 80 on both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, and it uses the default server name. The
# location block specifies that requests for the /api/ path should be proxied to the
# address 127.0.0.1:5002. Here is a brief explanation of how the server block works:
# * The listen directive tells the server to listen on port 80 on both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
# * The server_name directive specifies the default server name. This is the name that will be
# used if a client does not specify a hostname in their request.
# * The location block specifies that requests for the /api/ path should be proxied to the
# address 127.0.0.1:5002. This means that any requests that come in to the server on port 80
# and are for the /api/ path will be forwarded to the address 127.0.0.1:5002.
